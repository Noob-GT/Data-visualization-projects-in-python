## About the Video Course
Some popular Python data visualization tools and techniques today include Data Visualization in Jupyter Notebook with Bloomberg's bqplot library, Programming Graph and Network Data Visualizations, Data Visualizations with Bokeh (a Python library), and building interactive web visualizations using Dash.

You will start by programming stunning interactive Data Visualizations using bqplot, an open source Python library developed by Bloomberg. Then you will learn how to programmatically create interactive network graphs and visualizations. You will then programmatically visualize data with the interactive Python visualization library, Bokeh.

Finally, you will build interactive web visualizations of data using Python: you will choose a number of inputs your users can control, then use any Python graphing library to create plots based on those inputs.
